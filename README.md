## 🌐 APIs Used

All APIs are **free** and require **no API key**.

| API | Data | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| [REST Countries v4](https://restcountries.com) | Population, Density | `restcountries.com/v4/all` |
| [disease.sh](https://disease.sh) | COVID-19 stats | `disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries` |
| [WHO Outbreak News](https://www.who.int) | Disease alerts | `who.int/api/news/diseaseoutbreaknews` |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Content script** scans all text nodes on the page using a `TreeWalker`
2. Country names are matched using a regex of 200+ countries — longest names matched first to avoid partial matches (e.g. "United States" before "United")
3. Matched names are wrapped in a highlight `<span>`
4. On hover, the content script sends a message to the **background service worker**
5. The background worker fetches all 3 APIs in parallel using `Promise.allSettled`
6. Results are **cached for 30 minutes** to avoid redundant network calls
7. Data is sent back to the content script and rendered in the tooltip

```
User hovers "India"
       ↓
Content script → chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "getCountryData" })
       ↓
Background worker → fetch REST Countries + disease.sh + WHO (parallel)
       ↓
Return { demographics, covid, outbreaks }
       ↓
Content script renders tooltip
```

## 🔒 Permissions

| Permission | Reason |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Save extension on/off state |
| `tabs` | Read current tab URL for popup display |
| `activeTab` | Send messages to the active page |
| `host_permissions` | Fetch data from REST Countries, disease.sh, WHO |

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **React** — popup and options page UI
- **Vanilla JS** — content script and background worker (no framework overhead)
- **Webpack 5** — bundles React and keeps background/content scripts separate
- **Babel** — JSX and modern JS transpilation
- **Chrome Extensions Manifest V3**
